<p> Tech club is a small after school club run by students of TFSS. We look to open up the minds of our fellow peers to the power and potential of technology. Provide them with the means to excel in a tech centric world. App dev, web dev, and hardware are topics we actively explore. Its not important what technology controls, its important how you control technology.</p>
